# Nanocompore

---

**Software package that identifies raw signal changes between two conditions from [https://github.com/jts/nanopolish](nanopolish) resquiggled dRNA-Seq data.**

---

# Installation

IIdeally, before installation, create a clean python3 virtual environment to deploy the package, using virtualenvwrapper for example ([see tutorial](http://www.simononsoftware.com/virtualenv-tutorial-part-2/)).

## Dependencies

Nanocompore relies on a few Python third party libraries (tqdm and numpy). The correct versions of packages are installed together with the software when using pip.

## Installation with pip

* To install the package

    ```pip3 install git+https://github.com/a-slide/nanocompore.git```

* To update the package:

    ```pip3 install git+https://github.com/a-slide/nanocompore.git --upgrade```

# Usage

Nanocompore compares 2 nanopore sequencing datasets from 2 experimental conditions expected to hava an impact on DNA/RNA modifications. In particular the software was optimized to work with direct RNA sequencing data.

To use nanocompore raw nanopore sequencing data have to be prepared using a basecaller (Albacore or MInKNOW. Ask ONT), your favorite long read aligner such as [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) and resquiggled using [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish). Finally eventalign data have to be collapsed per kmer using [NanopolishComp Eventalign_collapse](https://github.com/a-slide/NanopolishComp)

The preparation of data and the package usage are detailed in the [usage jupyter notebook](https://github.com/a-slide/nanocompore/blob/master/tests/nanocompore_usage.ipynb)

# Note to power-users and developers

Please be aware that **nanocompore** is an experimental package that is still under development. It was tested under Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and in an HPC environment running under Red Hat Enterprise 7.1.
